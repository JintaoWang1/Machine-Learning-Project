# Project proposal for *Predicting number of rental bikes*
Author: *Jintao Wang*

## 1. Why: Question/Topic being investigated 1pt
I would like to understand better how to solve problems using regression models.The topic being investigated here is to predict total count of rental bikes based on weather and seasonal information using the yellowbrick Bikeshare dataset.


## 2. How: Plan of attack 1pt
I will use the Lab2 notebook as a template. I will create a regression workflow in a jupyter notebook and submit it. 

## 3. What: Dataset, models, framework, components 2pts
- UCI dataset *https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset* (12 features, 17379 samples)
- Scikit-learn LinearRegression, RandomForestRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor
